# This file defines the parameters for the auction plugin operation on your server.
# Let's examine each section in more detail for better understanding and configuration.
# ## Choosing the Database Type
# ```yaml
# Database Type: file | mysql
# db-type: file
# ```
# Specify the type of database to be used - `file` (local data storage) or `mysql` (MySQL operation).
# Note that the `mysql` type only works for servers within the BungeeCord network.
## MySQL Settings
# If the `mysql` type is chosen, specify the connection parameters to the database:
# ```yaml
# mysql-settings:
#   is-head: true  # Define whether this server is the head
#   host: 'localhost'
#   db-name: 'auction'
#   user: 'root'
#   password: ''
#   port: 3306
# ```
# - `is-head: true` indicates that this server is the head server.
#   The head server performs special functions, such as removing expired items from the auction.
# - Additionally, consider possible conflicts when removing items
#   if multiple servers declare themselves as heads. It is recommended to configure only one head server.
## Unique ID Generator Settings
# ```yaml
# name-generator:
#   last-seed: 1337
# ```
# These parameters are responsible for generating unique identifiers for items being sold and expired items.
# - `last-seed` represents the last used seed for generating identifiers.
#    Each time the plugin is launched, the seed increases by 1, ensuring uniqueness of identifiers.
## Recommendations for MySQL
# If you are using MySQL, it is recommended to:
#   - Configure initial seeds for each server to avoid seed intersection.
#     For example, the first server - 0, the second server - 10000, and so on, increasing by 10,000.
#   - This will prevent possible seed collisions when listing items for sale between servers.
## Notes and Warnings
# - Note that the seed cannot be negative, and its value is limited from 0 to 2,147,483,648.
# - Be careful when editing the configuration file to avoid losing changes made by the plugin.
#   These settings will help you properly configure the auction plugin for optimal operation on your server.
